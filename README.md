- Chrome extension to search words in backticks and generate a table to map from current to selected language convention. 

- Very simple currently, only maps var conventions. For the given list of languages there are only 2 cases: camel case and snake case.

- Clicking on table entry searches the word in the window. Cycles through the instances on each click and displays alert when no more instances. Restarts search from first instance.

- UI is and will be ugly unless someone steps up.

2. Go to More tools -> Extensions
